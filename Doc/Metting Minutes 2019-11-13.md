# Meeting 2019-11-13

Minutes from meeting PNL/Queens Collaboration Skype Call â€“ 10:30am
* PNL:  Jarrett Rushmore (JR)
* Queens: Kyle Sunderland (KS, Andras Lasso (AL)


## 1.	 Freessurfer Input
* a.	May make more sense to have a FS input feature / functionality 
* b.	Need a few complete input data sets (RJR to do)

## 2.	Example Segmentation
* a.	KS and RJR to "meet" next week so RJR can walk through a Lateral Ventricle Segmentation
Results - hard to automate too much because manual inclusion of choroid plexus required.  Also, correcting spill-throughs takes away from time.

## 3.	Next meeting : 12/12/2019: 10:30am
