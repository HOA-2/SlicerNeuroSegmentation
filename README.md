# SlicerNeuroSegmentation

SlicerNeuroSegmentation is an extension for [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org) designed to provide access to tools for segmenting neurological structures.

## Modules

- ### NeuroSegment
  This module provides access to tools for editing MRI images. Segments that are created using the module are automatically populated with the structures that need to be segmented.

- ### NeuroSegment Parcellation
  This module can perform volume reconstruction from tracked volume sequences.

- ### Curve Comparison
  This module evaluates the curve surface pathfinding parameters to find the parameters that perform optimally compared to a ground truth curve.

## User guides

- ### NeuroSegment
  Instructions on the steps required to perform segmentation of structures with NeuroSegment can be found [here](docs/General%20Segmentation.md).
